# parity-oddity

A little game designed & built together with Micgelf 
for [Pygame Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/pygame-jam-2025).

Game could be accessible on itch [here]([https://bepsi-shiki.itch.io/parity-oddity](https://hyikkup-shiki.itch.io/parity-oddity));
playable on both MacOS (Intel Chip & Apple Silicon) and Windows!

The `main` branch contains code for a generic platformer and a 
map editor, which I later forked and customized for the actual game. 
Under the `mess/gliding` branch will you find all the code used for 
building the executables, hahaa.

We hope you enjoyed it!
