# untitled-gem-platformer

A little game designed & built together with Micgelf 
for [Pygame Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/pygame-jam-2025).

Here's the published link: 

The `main` branch contains code for a generic platformer and a 
map editor, which I later forked and customized for the actual game. 
The `mess/gliding` contains all the code used for building, hahaa.

We hope you enjoyed it!
